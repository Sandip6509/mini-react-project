Project Counter App
To practice you skills

Step 1
Set up your project
To get started, create a new React project using your preferred method. You can use npm create vite@latest or a similar tool to set up your project.

Step 2
Create a Counter component
Create a new file called Counter.js and create a functional component inside it. Inside the component, use the useState hook to create a count state variable and initialize it to 0. Render the count variable inside a div element.

Step 3
Add increment and decrement buttons
Add two buttons to your component, one to increment the count variable and one to decrement it. Use the onClick event to update the count variable using the setCount function returned by useState.
